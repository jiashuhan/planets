# A simple Newtonian Solar System simulation

To run this simulation, first enter the mass and state vector (position and velocity) of the object and add it to the list. The J2000.0 parameters of all the major planets in the Solar System, as well as some comets, are already provided. Once all the objects are entered, set the duration and time resolution (steps per day) of the simulation and start the run. The simulation is accurate for a few decades starting from J2000 with a time resolution of 1 step per day. Note: with 10 steps per day, it predicts the next perihelion of Halley's comet to be around Oct. 31, 2060, which is 9 months too early. 

You can also generate random objects by entering values in the bottom right corner. This creates a number of objects with random velocities within a given radius.
